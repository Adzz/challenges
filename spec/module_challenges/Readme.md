Module Challenges
-----------------

Purpose
-------

These will explore what modules are and what they do.

To run
------

These are broken up into two groups of challenges,
exploring namespacing constants, and altering inheritance
with `include`.

```sh
$ mrspec spec/module_challenges/namespace_spec.rb
$ mrspec spec/module_challenges/include_spec.rb
```

Suggestions
-----------

* Skim the code in the specs for unusual looking things.


Suggested Order
---------------

These are ordered within the two files,
go through them in that order.


### Namespacing

Try to get through `MahMod::Dir`, at least.
The ones after that really push the boundaries,
but up to that one, it's just namespacing constants.


### Include

Try to get through the whole thing.
You may need to do an internet search for how to raise exceptions.
If you have a specific question you need answered before you can move on,
then try thinking of an experiment that will answer it,
then run the experiment to find the answer for yourself!
