List Recursion
==============

Build a linked list that operates recursively,
and adheres closely to the "functional" paradigm
of computer programming.


Purpose
-------

Get exposure to other ways of programming, which solve
problems very differently.

Bend your brain.


Suggestions
-----------

* You will have no loops.
* The purpose of the "NilNode" is to prevent you from
  having to check to see whether the node you're talking to
  is `nil` or not. You just talk to it like it's a normal node,
  and it will do whatever you would have done when you would have
  hit that last `nil` node.


To run
------

```sh
$ mrspec spec/list_recursion/all_challenges_spec
```
