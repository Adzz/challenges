Iterable
========

Here, you'll build your own version of Enumerable.

Purpose
-------

Take something that can be difficult to remember, and rather magical,
and reduce it to a thing that is completely within your grasp.
This will improve your ability to remember the best-choice enumerable
methods, and to reason about how they work, and create your own,
when there is not already one that does what you need.

Suggested Order
---------------

* First do [linked list functions](../linked_list_functions)
* Then do [block_challenges](../block_challenges)
* Then do [module_challenges](../module_challenges)
* Then you will be ready to do these in the following order:
  * `1_object_oriented_linked_list_spec.rb`
    You'll create your own array-like class.
  * `2_prep_linked_list_spec.rb`
  * `3_iterable_spec.rb`
    You'll create your own `Enumerable`, names `Iterable,
    that does all the things Enumerable does, but using your
    linked list instead of Array.
